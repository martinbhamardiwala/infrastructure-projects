## 📌 Project Description

This project involved establishing a reliable network connection between **two geographically separated locations** where traditional wired connectivity was either **cost-prohibitive or impractical**. The client initially considered fiber deployment, but due to distance and cost constraints, a **Point-to-Point (P2P) wireless solution** was proposed and successfully implemented.

The solution provided **low latency, high stability, and cost efficiency**, enabling seamless communication between both networks.

## 🧩 Client Requirement

The client required:

- Connectivity between **two different buildings / locations**
- Distance between sites: **approximately 2–3 km**
- Low latency network performance
- Stable and secure link for continuous operations
- A **cost-effective alternative** to long-distance fiber deployment
- Minimal maintenance and fast deployment

## 💡 Proposed Solution

After evaluating available options, the following solution was recommended:

- **Point-to-Point (P2P) Wireless Link**
- Enterprise-grade **Cambium Networks P2P devices**
- Line-of-sight wireless connectivity
- Secure bridge mode configuration
- Fiber-like performance without physical cabling

This approach significantly reduced deployment cost and time while meeting all performance expectations.
